This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), [`rainbow-kit`](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit) and [`tailwind-css`](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Getting Started

First, create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory and add your API key

```
ETHPASS_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/ethpass](http://localhost:3000/api/ethpass).

## Examples

### Creating a pass

This example contains everything you need to create your first pass.

Fill out the form with the details of the NFT in the wallet you want to create a pass for. Manually inputting the required parameters is for demo purposes only. You'll likely replace this with data aggregated from your integration. E.g. (OpenSea, Alchemy, Zora)
